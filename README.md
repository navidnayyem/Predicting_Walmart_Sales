# Predicting_Walmart_Sales

# Explanation of Code:
My project code is a comprehensive implementation of a machine learning project aimed at predicting Walmart's sales. It begins by importing essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, and seaborn for data manipulation, numerical operations, visualization, and machine learning model building. These libraries provide a solid foundation for the subsequent tasks.

Firstly, the code reads the dataset from a CSV file named 'Walmart.csv' into a pandas DataFrame named dataset. This step is crucial as it forms the basis for all further data processing and analysis. The dataset likely contains various features such as date, store number, temperature, fuel price, CPI (Consumer Price Index), unemployment rate, and weekly sales.

Following data loading, the code performs extensive data preprocessing. It converts the 'Date' column to datetime format and extracts additional features such as day, month, and year. Feature engineering enriches the dataset by providing more meaningful insights, such as the day of the week. Duplicate rows are also removed to ensure data cleanliness and integrity.

Visualization plays a significant role in understanding the data and identifying patterns. The code utilizes various visualization techniques, including boxplots, histograms, barplots, and heatmaps, to explore the dataset's characteristics. Boxplots reveal outliers in numerical columns, while histograms illustrate the distribution of weekly sales over different years and months. Barplots showcase weekly sales trends by store and month, offering valuable insights into sales patterns.

Model building and evaluation form the core of the project. The code trains and evaluates several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, K-Neighbors Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. These models are trained using features such as store number, holiday flag, temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rate to predict weekly sales. It splits the data into 70% training and 30% testing sets.

Evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R^2 are calculated to assess model performance. Additionally, the code explores deep learning techniques by implementing an LSTM model for time series prediction. Different configurations of the LSTM model, varying in the number of units, dropout rate, epochs, and batch size, are evaluated to identify the optimal settings for predicting weekly sales. Here the data is splitted into 70% training and 30% testing sets.

Time series forecasting model is implemented using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with Keras. Initially, it imports necessary libraries including Keras for building the model. The data is prepared by scaling it using MinMaxScaler. The function create_sequences() is defined to create input-output pairs for the LSTM model with a specified sequence length. The data is split into training and testing sets, and an LSTM model is constructed with two layers of LSTM cells, each with 50 units, followed by a dense output layer. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function. Training is conducted with the training data for 50 epochs and a batch size of 32, while validating the model's performance on the test data. Predictions are made on the test data and then inverted to the original scale using the inverse scaler. Finally, the actual versus predicted weekly sales is visualized, using matplotlib.

In conclusion, my project code demonstrates a comprehensive approach to predicting Walmart's sales using machine learning and deep learning techniques particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. After preprocessing the dataset and conducting extensive feature engineering and visualization, the code trains and evaluates various machine learning models, assessing their performance using metrics like RMSE, MSE, MAE and R^2. Additionally, it explores LSTM networks for time series forecasting, experimenting with different configurations to optimize sales predictions. The project provides valuable insights for retail businesses to enhance inventory management and strategic decision-making processes.
